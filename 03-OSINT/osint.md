- **Decentralized Identity (DIDs):** Each user has a persistent DID (Decentralized Identifier) that remains constant even when handles change
- **Personal Data Servers (PDS):** Users can self-host data; identify via DID document
- **Content addressing:** Posts are content-addressed via CIDs (Content Identifiers)
- **Firehose access:** Public real-time feed of all network activity
- **Labelers:** Custom moderation services; check which labelers users subscribe to
- **Starter packs:** Curated user lists; track community formation

**Bluesky Investigation Workflow:**
1. Resolve handle to DID: `https://bsky.social/xrpc/com.atproto.identity.resolveHandle?handle=<handle>`
2. Retrieve identity document: `https://plc.directory/<did>`
3. Extract PDS endpoint, handle history, and verification methods
4. Monitor firehose for keyword/hashtag mentions
5. Map follower networks using SkyView
6. Archive posts early (users can delete and migrate)

> [!WARNING]
> AT Protocol is decentralized. Users can change handles, migrate between PDS servers, and delete content. Always archive DIDs, CIDs, and post snapshots immediately.

- [Mastodon Instances](https://instances.social/): Instance directory with filters
- [FediDB](https://fedidb.org/): Fediverse statistics and software tracking

**Fediverse OSINT Considerations:**
- **Instance matters:** Different instances have different jurisdictions, moderation policies, and data retention
- **WebFinger discovery:** `https://<instance>/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:<user>@<instance>`
- **ActivityPub protocol:** Federation is asynchronous; deletions may not propagate immediately
- **Privacy settings:** Users can restrict follower visibility and post visibility
- **Software diversity:** Mastodon, Pleroma, Pixelfed, PeerTube, Misskey all federate differently

**Mastodon Investigation Workflow:**
1. Identify instance: `@username@instance.social`
2. Query WebFinger for ActivityPub actor URL
3. Extract follower/following lists (if public)
4. Search posts via FediSearch or instance-specific search
5. Enumerate instance software and version
6. Check relay servers for deleted content
7. Map cross-instance network graphs

> [!NOTE]
> Fediverse content may persist on relay servers and caches even after deletion. Some instances (e.g., Pixelfed for images, PeerTube for videos) have different data models.

## Evidence Handling & OPSEC

> [!CAUTION]
> **Operational Security Considerations for OSINT Investigators:**

### Evidence Collection Best Practices

- Capture URLs, timestamps, and page snapshots (PNG + WARC/SingleFileZ) for every key artifact.
- Hash downloaded files (SHA-256) and record in your case notes.
- Avoid cross-contamination: separate work profiles/containers per case; store evidence read-only.
- Prefer JSONL (NDJSON) logs with a `run_id` and tool versions for reproducibility.
- Use UTC timestamps consistently across all documentation.
- Maintain a chain of custody: document who collected what, when, and how.
- Store evidence in encrypted containers or air-gapped systems for sensitive cases.

### Browser Isolation & Persona Management

- Use separate browser profiles or container tabs (Firefox Multi-Account Containers, Chrome Profiles) for each investigation or persona.
- Consider dedicated OSINT browsers: [Mullvad Browser](https://mullvad.net/en/browser), [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/).
- Use virtual machines or containerized environments (Kasm, Whonix) for high-risk investigations.
- Never log into personal accounts from investigative browsers.
- Implement browser fingerprinting countermeasures (Canvas Defender, AudioContext Defender).

### Network Anonymity

- Use VPNs or proxies when appropriate (consider legal implications in your jurisdiction).
- Rotate IP addresses and user agents to avoid rate limiting and tracking.
- Use [ProxyChains](https://github.com/haad/proxychains) or [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) for enhanced anonymity.
- Be aware of DNS leaks; use DNS over HTTPS (DoH) or DNS over TLS (DoT).
- For high-risk investigations, consider using [Tails OS](https://tails.boum.org/) or [Whonix](https://www.whonix.org/).

### Sock Puppet Management

- Create believable personas with consistent backstories, posting history, and activity patterns.
- Use dedicated devices, email addresses, phone numbers (VoIP/burner), and payment methods for each persona.
- Build personas gradually over weeks/months before active investigation.
- Never reuse usernames, emails, or passwords across personas.
- Use password managers (KeePassXC, Bitwarden) to track persona credentials securely.
- Be aware of platform TOS violations; sock puppets may violate terms of service.

### Data Sanitization

- Redact PII, sensitive IOCs, and unique identifiers before sharing reports or screenshots.
- Strip metadata (EXIF, document properties) from files before distribution.
- Use [Mat2](https://0xacab.org/jvoisin/mat2) or [ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/) for batch metadata removal.
- Be cautious with cloud-based tools; assume data persistence and potential correlation.

### Legal & Ethical Considerations

> [!WARNING]
> **Legal Disclaimer:** OSINT activities must comply with applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. Unauthorized access, impersonation, harassment, doxxing, and other illegal activities are prohibited. Always consult legal counsel before conducting sensitive investigations.

- Respect platform Terms of Service (even if technically possible, scraping may violate TOS).
- Avoid unauthorized access (do not brute force, exploit vulnerabilities, or bypass authentication).
- Do not weaponize OSINT for harassment, doxxing, stalking, or intimidation.
- Follow responsible disclosure practices when discovering vulnerabilities or exposures.
- Be aware of privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) and data protection regulations.
- Document your methodology and maintain ethical boundaries.
